RecognizedString no its not some creepy thing okay i'm usually just looking for old electronic stuff architect my workshop in hack now 15 23
RecognizedString i do have a fetish for cd rom drives ok each ones got three different motors to naked built things that move 23 30
RecognizedString your switches seek turn things on and off and there's even a freaking laser see can make a cool robot 30 37
RecognizedString into an awesome robot now 37 41
RecognizedString i've builds a lot of stuff out of garbage and so many things of evening kind of useful but just thing 41 48
RecognizedString for me garbage is just a chance the play to be creative and built things to muse myself this is what i love doing so i just made a part of my day job 48 57
RecognizedString this is just a place where people can come and ask fascinating questions 69 73
RecognizedString and find answers and i realized along time ago that unify challenge people to build equipment they need out of the garbage ice find it's a great wait a foster creativity 73 85
RecognizedString and what happened was that artist and scientists from around the world started coming to my lab it's not just because we value on conventional ideas 85 94
RecognizedString it's because we test and validate them with scientific reader 94 99
RecognizedString i can and if you guys tell me what fruit dices 119 124
RecognizedString what was that it's right it's an apple now i'll actually want you to can a notices well that this is a lot better than most apples 124 133
RecognizedString ok and that's because we grew humans sells into it 133 136
RecognizedString we took a totally innocent macintosh apple removed all the apple cells and dna and then implants at human cells and white were left with after removing all the apple sells is the cellular scaffold 136 151
RecognizedString the stuff that gives plants there shape and texture and these little holes that you can see this is where all the apple sells used to be 151 159
RecognizedString so then we come along we implant some i'm aliens sells which you can seem blue 159 163
RecognizedString and what happens is these guy start multiplying in a philip this entire scaffold now as we're does this is 163 170
RecognizedString it's actually really reminiscing of our own tissues are organized 170 175
RecognizedString can we found in are pre clinical work 175 177
RecognizedString that you can a plenty scaffold into the body and this body will send and cells in a butts play and actually keep these things alive this is the point one people started asking me andrew 177 189
RecognizedString can you make body parts out of apples 189 193
RecognizedString i don't like you come to the right place so i actually brought the sup with my wife a she's a musical instrument maker and she does a lot of wood carving for living and so i asked for you know 193 206
RecognizedString could you like literally car of some ears out of an apple for us 206 211
RecognizedString and she did so i took her ears too loud 211 215
RecognizedString we then started preparing them 215 217
RecognizedString and this is the result so listen my lab is not in the ear manufacturing business ok 229 237
RecognizedString couple of actually been working on this for like decades here's the issue 237 242
RecognizedString commercial sky fords are can be really expensive and problematic because they're source from proprietary products animals or covers 242 254
RecognizedString we used an apple and it cost pennies 254 260
RecognizedString now what's asa really cool here is is not that hard to make these things equipment you need can be built from garbage and the key processing step only requires soap 260 271
RecognizedString and water so what we did was put all the instructions on line as open source 271 276
RecognizedString and then was founded admission driven company and we're developing kids to make it easier for anyone with the sync and a soldering iron to make tea sings at home 276 286
RecognizedString what i'm actually really curious about is if one day it'll be possible to repair rebuild and augment our own bodies 286 295
RecognizedString with stuff we make in the kitchen now 295 299
RecognizedString speaking of kittens here's some asparagus ok there tasty and endemic your pee smell funny now 299 308
RecognizedString i was my kitchen and i was noticing that when you look down the stocks of these asparagus what you can see are all these tiny little vessels 308 315
RecognizedString and when we image them in the lab you can see how the cellular forms these structures 315 320
RecognizedString this image reminds me to things are blood vessels 320 325
RecognizedString and the struck turn organization of our nerves and spinal cord 325 329
RecognizedString so here's the question can we grow axons and neurons down these channels in cause if you can the maybe we can using asparagus 329 340
RecognizedString to form new connections between the ends of damaged and severed nerves 340 345
RecognizedString or maybe even the spinal cord 345 347
RecognizedString no don't give me wrong misses exceptionally challenging in really hard work to do and we're not the only once working on this 347 356
RecognizedString but we are tiana ones using asparagus 356 361
RecognizedString at right now we've got really promising pilot data and will working with tissue engineers and neurosurgeon to find out with actually possible 361 370
RecognizedString to listen all of the work i've shown you the stuff that i built that's like all around me on the stage an yellow project my labs envolved in are all at direct result of me playing with your garbage 370 383
RecognizedString play play 383 385
RecognizedString is a key part of my scientific practice itali train my mind to be on conventional and to be creative and to decide to make human apple yours 385 396
RecognizedString i want you to think of me because i one it's so seriously please fine any way to get in touch with me 405 414
RecognizedString and let's see what we can field 414 416
