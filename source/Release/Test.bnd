RecognizedString a virtually unknown german mathematician name theodore khaled sir 15.7 22.4
RecognizedString suggested a very bald end 22.4 26
RecognizedString in some ways very bizarre idea he propose that our universe mine actually have more than the three dimensions 26 34.3
RecognizedString that we are all aware that isn't addition to left right back fourth and up down 34.3 40.1
RecognizedString good super pause at the my additional dimensions of space that for some reason 40.1 46
RecognizedString we don't yet see now 46 48.8
RecognizedString when someone makes a bolden bizarre idea sometime that old is bald design has nothing to do with the world around us this particular idea however 48.8 59
RecognizedString although we don't know whether it's right or wrong and at the end of discuss experiments which in the next year's may tell us what that's right or wrong this ideas had a major impact on physics in the last century 59 70.6
RecognizedString and continues to inform a lot of cutting edge research i'd like to tell you something about the story these extra dimensions 70.6 77.9
RecognizedString so where do we go to begin need a backstory 77.9 81.1
RecognizedString go to nineteen oh seven this is a year when einstein is bathinda glow of having discover the special theory of relativity indecisive take on a new 81.1 91.9
RecognizedString project to try to understand fully the graham perv a serve force 91.9 98
RecognizedString of gravity and in the moment there are many people around who father dad 98 104.2
RecognizedString project already been resolve newton have given the world 104.2 107.9
RecognizedString the theory of gravity late sixteen hundred that works well describes emotion of planet the most of the moon and so forest 107.9 115.6
RecognizedString in the motion of a pocketful apples five from trees any people in the head olive add could be describe using newton's work but 115.6 123.5
RecognizedString einstein realize it new net left something out of the story because even newton had written that'll though he understood how 123.5 132
RecognizedString to calculate effective gravity havent unable to figure out how it really works how was it that the sun ninety three million miles away somehow defects 132 141.4
RecognizedString the motion of the earth how does the sun reach out across empty a nerd space and exert 141.4 147.7
RecognizedString influence and that is a task to which einstein set himself to figure out how gravity works and let me show you what it is that he found so einstein found that the medium that transmit 147.7 159.9
RecognizedString gravity is space itself the idea goes like this 159.9 163.4
RecognizedString imagine spaces a substrate of all the resign sunset spaces nice in flat 163.4 168.1
RecognizedString if there's no matter present but if there is matter in the environment such as the sonic causes the fabric of space to worp to curve and bakshi minute kate's the force of gravity even the earth 168.1 181.4
RecognizedString worp space around it now look at the moon the moon is captain orbit according to his ideas because it rolls along valley in the curved environment that vd 181.4 191.6
RecognizedString sun and the moon and the earth can all create my virtue of there presents we go to a full frame view of this 191.6 198.5
RecognizedString the earth itself is captain or because it rosa long valley in the environment that's curve because of the sons presents 198.5 206.1
RecognizedString that is this new idea about how gravity actually works now 206.1 212.6
RecognizedString this ideas tested nineteen nineteen through astronomical observations it really works describes data and this game to einstein prominent 212.6 222.4
RecognizedString around the world and that is what got 222.4 225.7
RecognizedString call it's a thinking he like einstein wasn't search of what we call a unified theory 225.7 232.1
RecognizedString that's one theory that might be able to describe all of nature's forces from one sit of ideas one set a principles one master equation if you will supposed to say to himself 232.1 244
RecognizedString einstein has been able to describe gravity in terms of worp see curves in space in fact space and time to more precise maybe i can play 244 253.5
RecognizedString the same game with the other known force which was at that time 253.5 258.4
RecognizedString known as the electromagnetic force mean of other today but that time that was jani other one people thinking about your the forces father electricity and magnetic attraction in so fourths 258.4 267.9
RecognizedString it's a quarter says maybe i can play the same game describe electromagnetic force in terms of works in curves 267.9 274.5
RecognizedString that raise the question warped in curves in what einstein it already used up space and time 274.5 282.3
RecognizedString watching curves to describe gravity didn't seem to be anything else the war curve succulent to said well 282.3 290.3
RecognizedString maybe there are more dimensions of spacey said ever want describe one more force maybe i need one more dimension zoe imagine that what had for dimensions a space not three 290.3 300.8
RecognizedString and maginet electromagnet as watching curves in that fourth dimension 300.8 305.6
RecognizedString now here's the thing when you wrote down the equations describing warped in craven university force base dimensions not three 305.6 312
RecognizedString he found the old equations that einstein ahead already driving three dimensions buzzer for gravity buddy found one more equation because of the one more dimension 312 321.7
RecognizedString emily look that equation it was none other than the equation that site has had long known to describe electromagnetic force 321.7 329
RecognizedString amazing it just popped up he was so excited by this realization that he ran around is house screaming victory that he had found unified theory 329 339.5
RecognizedString now clearly collects was a man who took 339.5 344.1
RecognizedString theory very seriously he in fact there's a story that when he want to learn how to swim 344.1 350.8
RecognizedString he read a book or treat is on swimming than dove into the ocean 350.8 356.5
RecognizedString this is manhood risk kids life on theory 356.5 360.1
RecognizedString now buffalos abbas her a little more practically minded to questions immediately arise from his observation number one if there are more dimensions is bass where are they 360.1 370.6
RecognizedString you don't seem to see them and number to does this theory really work in detail when you try to apply it to the world 370.6 378.6
RecognizedString around us now the first question 378.6 381.9
RecognizedString was answered in nineteen twenty six 381.9 384.2
RecognizedString by felony moscow klein he's suggested that dimensions might come into varieties there might be big easy to see dimensions put them i also be tiny curled up dimensions product so small even other all around us 384.2 398.4
RecognizedString that we don't see them let me show you that one visually 398.4 402.3
RecognizedString so imagi looking at something like a cable supporting a traffic light sim manhattan new central park let's have relevant but the cable what's one dimensional 402.3 412.3
RecognizedString from a distance view point but you know another does hasn't thickness it's very hard to see the from far away but resume in 412.3 419.7
RecognizedString and take your perspective it's a little am walking around little answer so small that they can access all dimensions belong dimension process clockwise or counterclockwise direction in 419.7 430.6
RecognizedString i hope you preciate as it took so long to get these ants to do this put this illustrate the fact that dimensions cambia tu sorts big and small 430.6 439.8
RecognizedString and the ideas maybe the big dimensions around us other ones that we can easily c 439.8 444.8
RecognizedString but there might be additional dimensions curled up sort of like the circular part of that cable so small 444.8 451.1
RecognizedString that they have so far remained invisible let me show me what that would look like so we take a look say at space itself 451.1 459.9
RecognizedString i can only show of course to dimensions on a screen some you gotta fix that one day but anything that's not flat screen as a new dimension go smaller 459.9 467.6
RecognizedString smaller smaller and way down in the microscopic depths of space itself this is the idea 467.6 473.9
RecognizedString you could have additional curled up dimensions here's a little shape of circle so small that we don't see them but if you were a little ultra microscopic aunt walking randy can walk in the big mentioned that we all know about that's like the grid part 473.9 486
RecognizedString but you can also access the tiny curled up dimension 486 489.4
RecognizedString that's so small that we can't see with a naked iyer even with any ramos refind equipment but deeply talked into the fabric of space itself the ideas the could be more dimensions as we see there now 489.4 503
RecognizedString an explanation about how the universe could have more dimensions than the ones that we see but what about the second question that i asked 505.2 512.4
RecognizedString does it theory actually work when you try to reply to the real world well turns out that einstein include send many others worked on trying to refine this framework and apply it too 512.4 525.8
RecognizedString the physics of universe as was understood at the time 525.8 529.6
RecognizedString any detail didn't work and detail friends that couldn't get the mass of the electron to workout correctly in this theory so many people work donna popeye the 529.6 539.4
RecognizedString fourty certainly by the fifties this strange but very compelling idea of how to unify the laws of physics had gone away 539.4 549.4
RecognizedString until something wonderful happened in our h 549.4 552.6
RecognizedString in our era a new approach to unify the laws of physics is being pursued by physicistt sajid myself many others around the world is called super strength earring as you are indicating 552.6 564
RecognizedString and the wonderful thing is that super string theory has nothing to do at first sight with this idea of actor dimensions 564 572.2
RecognizedString but we study super string theory find reza rex 572.2 575.4
RecognizedString the idea of sparkling new form 575.4 578
RecognizedString let me just tell you how that go super string theory what is it was a the're the tries to answer the question what are the basic fundamental indivisible on ca double constantia wants making up 578 590.1
RecognizedString everything in the world around us 590.1 592.5
RecognizedString the idea is like this so imagine we look at a familiar object just a candle in a holder and imagine that we wanna figure out what it is made of so we go on a journey deep inside the object examine 592.5 606.1
RecognizedString the can stitch wants to deep inside the all now yos officially far down you have adams 606.1 611
RecognizedString we also all know the adams not the end of the story they had little electrons it's warm miranda central nucleus what neutron protons 611 619
RecognizedString even a neutrons and protons it's more particles inside of them known as corpse that is were conventional idea stop 619 627
RecognizedString here's the new id of string theory 627 629.1
RecognizedString deep inside any of these particles there is something else the something else is this dancing filament of energy it looks like a vibrating string 629.1 638.3
RecognizedString that's where the idea string theory comes from and just like the vibrating strings that you just sona chela can vibrate indifferent patterns these can also vibrating different patterns 638.3 647.6
RecognizedString they don't produced different musical notes rather they produce the different particles making up the world around us 647.6 653.5
RecognizedString to these ideas are correct this is what the ultra microscopic landscape of 653.5 658.2
RecognizedString the universe looks like it's built up of a huge number of the little tiny phil immense 658.2 664
RecognizedString a vibrating energy vibrating indifferent frequencies the different frequencies produce the different particles different particles 664 672.2
RecognizedString are responsible for all the rich this in the world around us and they're uc unification 672.2 678.3
RecognizedString because matter particles electrons in corpse radiation particles fo times gravity has are all built up from one entity 678.3 687.5
RecognizedString so matter and the forces of nature o 687.5 690.5
RecognizedString are put together under the rubric vibrating strings and that's what we mean by a unified theory a here is the catch 690.5 699.7
RecognizedString when you study the mathematics or string theory you find the doesn't work in a universe that just has three dimensional space it doesn't work any universe with for dimensions a space nor five nor sex 699.7 711.6
RecognizedString finally even study the equation show that it works only any universe that has ten dimensions of space 711.6 719.3
RecognizedString and one dimension of time 719.3 722
RecognizedString cletus right back to this idea of gluten klein that are world when appropriately described has more dimensions than the ones that we see 722 733
RecognizedString now you might think about that say well ok enough yeah i've actually dimensions in really tightly curled up 733 739.3
RecognizedString yep perhaps perhaps we won't see them if there's more enough but you know if there's a little tiny civilization agree people walking around and they're you make them small enough we won't see them either 739.3 748.8
RecognizedString that is true one of the other predictions of string theory 748.8 753.4
RecognizedString no its not one of the other prediction did string theory but erase the question are we just trying to hideaway these actually dimensions or 753.4 762.8
RecognizedString do they tell or something about the world and the remaining tom i'd like to tell you to features of them 762.8 768.3
RecognizedString first is many others believe that these actor dimensions hold the answer to what perhaps is the deepest question in theoretical physics theoretical science and that question is this when we look around the world 768.3 783.4
RecognizedString as scientists of down for less hundred years there appear to be about twenty numbers 783.4 787.9
RecognizedString that really describe our universities are numbers like the mass of the particles like electrons in corpse 787.9 793.7
RecognizedString strength of gravity this drain electromagnetic force a list about twenty numbers that happen measured with incredible precision but nobody has an explanation for why the numbers have the particular values that they do 793.7 807.9
RecognizedString now 807.9 810.2
RecognizedString does string theory often answer not yet but we believe the answer for why those numbers have devise they do mabe rely on the form of the actor dimensions in the wonderful thing is if those numbers had any other vi is then the known once 810.2 823.1
RecognizedString the universe as we know it wouldn't exist 823.1 826.4
RecognizedString this is a deep question why this number so finally tuned to stars to shining planets to form when we recognize that you fiddle with those numbers if i had twenty dials up here and let you come up and silver those numbers 826.4 838.9
RecognizedString almost any feeling makes 838.9 841.2
RecognizedString the evers disappear to can we explain those twenty numbers and string theory suggested this twenty numbers have to do with the actor dimensions let me show you how 841.2 852.2
RecognizedString so when we talk about the actor dimensions e string theory 852.2 856.1
RecognizedString it's not one actually dimension as in the older ideas of closer and klein this is what string theory says about the actually dimensions they have a very rich 856.1 866.6
RecognizedString enter twice find geometry this is an example of something on as a columbia shape 866.6 871.9
RecognizedString name isn't all that important but as you can see 871.9 875.4
RecognizedString the extra dimensions fold n on themselves in inter twine in a very interesting shape interesting structure any ideas that if this is what 875.4 885.1
RecognizedString the extra dimensions look like then the microscopic landscape of our universe all around us 885.1 891.4
RecognizedString what look like this on the tiniest of scales when you swing your hand ub moving around is actually dimensions over and over again but they're so small that we wouldn't know it 891.4 899.9
RecognizedString so what is the physical implication no relevant has twenty numbers consider this 899.9 904.2
RecognizedString you look at the instrument a french or notice that the vibrations of air streams are affected by the shape of the instrument now in string theory all the numbers 904.2 913.5
RecognizedString i reflections of the way strings can vibrate to just does air streams are affected by the twists in turns instrument 913.5 920.9
RecognizedString strings and salisbury affected by the vibration or patterns in geometry 920.9 925.5
RecognizedString within which they are moving salami bring some strings into the story and if you watch these little feliz vibrating around 925.5 931.9
RecognizedString the be her in a second right there norris at the way they vibrate is affected by the geometry the actually dimensions 931.9 938.3
RecognizedString so if we knew exactly what the actor dimensions looks like we don't yet but if we did we should be able to calculate the allowed notes 938.3 945.8
RecognizedString the allowed vibration or patterns and if we can talk like a vibration of patterns we should be able to calculate those twenty numbers have the answer that we get from are calculations 945.8 957.7
RecognizedString agrees with the values of those numbers that have been determine through detailed in precise experiment tation 957.7 964.9
RecognizedString this in many ways would be the first fundamental explanation for why the structure of the universe is 964.9 972.9
RecognizedString the way it is now the second su that i want to finish up with this 972.9 977.4
RecognizedString how might we 977.4 979.5
RecognizedString test for these extra dimensions more directly is this just in interesting mathematical structure that might be able to explain some 979.5 989.4
RecognizedString previously on explain features of the world 989.4 992.4
RecognizedString or coming actually test for the next dimensions and we think as i think very exciting that the next five years are so we may be able to test for the existence of these exit imagines here's how it goes 992.4 1005.8
RecognizedString in cern geneva switzerland machine is being built ha the large hadron collider 1005.8 1012.1
RecognizedString it's machine that will send particles around tunnel opposite directions near the speed of light every so often does particles will be named at each other to lose ahead on collision 1012.1 1022.9
RecognizedString the hope is that if the collision has enough energy it me a jet 1022.9 1028.8
RecognizedString some of the debrief from the collision from our dimensions 1028.8 1032.9
RecognizedString forcing it to enter into the other dimensions how we know it 1032.9 1037.1
RecognizedString what will measure the amount of energy after the collision compare at the math energy before afters less energy 1037.1 1044.4
RecognizedString after the collision number for this a b evidence that the energy has drift away if address away the right pattern that we can calculate disobey evidence 1044.4 1052.5
RecognizedString that the extra dimensions are there let me show you that idea visually 1052.5 1056.2
RecognizedString so magine we have a certain kinda particles called a grab a ton that's kind of debris we expect to be injected out if the actor dimensions are real but here's had experimental go 1056.2 1067.2
RecognizedString you take is particles you slam them together you slam it together and if we are write some of the energy that collision will go into debris that flies off 1067.2 1076.3
RecognizedString into these actor dimensions so this is a kind of experiment that will be looking at the next five 1076.3 1081.8
RecognizedString seven two ten years yourself and 1081.8 1084.7
RecognizedString if this experiment bears fruit if we see that kind of particle injected 1084.7 1089.5
RecognizedString by noticing that there's less energy in our dimensions then when we began this will show the theater dimensions are real 1089.5 1097.5
RecognizedString enemy this is a really remarkable store in a remarkable opportunity going back to newton with absolute space diddy 1097.5 1104.6
RecognizedString pride anything button arena stage in which the events the universe take place einstein comes along in says will space and time can worp and curve that's what gravity is and now 1104.6 1114.9
RecognizedString string theory comes along and says yes gravity quantum mechanics electra magnum altogether one package but only if the universe has more dimensions than the ones that we see 1114.9 1126.3
RecognizedString and this is an experiment that may test for them in our lifetime 1126.3 1131.5
RecognizedString mazing possible thank you very much 1131.5 1134.4
