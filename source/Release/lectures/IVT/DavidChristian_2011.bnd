RecognizedString what you want is just a right about and planets to turns out adjust right because i close to sauce but not too close 544.9 551.5
RecognizedString you also need great diversity of chemical elements 551.5 555.6
RecognizedString and you need liquid such as water why will in gassy 555.6 561.2
RecognizedString adams move past each other so fast com teacher in solids 561.2 567.2
RecognizedString adam stuck together by comp move in liquids 567.2 571.5
RecognizedString bacon cruise an cuddle and link up to for molecule 571.5 577.3
RecognizedString what would you find search goldilocks conditions will planets great and our early earth was almost perfect 577.3 586.2
RecognizedString it was just write distance from it start contain huge oceans of liquid water 586.2 590.8
RecognizedString deep any photos oceans cracks in the earth frost 590.8 594.5
RecognizedString you got heat cpr from inside the earth and you got a great diversity of elements to those deep oceanic vans 594.5 602.5
RecognizedString scrambled egg is much tasty marsh but it's marsh 51.2 54.3
RecognizedString fantastic chemistry began to happen on atoms combined and all sorts of exotic combinations 602.5 608
RecognizedString of course life is more than just exotic chemistry 608 613.3
RecognizedString how you stabilizer those huge molecules seem to be viable 613.3 619
RecognizedString let's hear life introduce isn't entirely new trick 619 624.2
RecognizedString you don't stabilizer the individual 624.2 627.3
RecognizedString you stabilizer the template thing but currys information and you allow template tickle pizza 627.3 633.7
RecognizedString and dna of calls is the beautiful molecule 633.7 637.2
RecognizedString that contains that information you'll be familiar with a double helix dna each wrong contains information 637.2 644.7
RecognizedString to dna contains information about how to make living organisms 644.7 649.4
RecognizedString and dna also copies it's off to copies itself status the templates 649.4 654.7
RecognizedString an egg is a beautiful sophisticated thing concrete even more sophisticated things such as chickens 54.3 60.6
RecognizedString through the ocean for the information spreads notice that information is become powerball story 654.7 660.5
RecognizedString the real beauty of dna though isn't it's infection as it copies itself once in every billion runs 660.5 668.4
RecognizedString the ten to be an era and what that means is dna is in a fact learning 668.4 674.9
RecognizedString it's accumulating new ways of making living organisms because some of those arrows work to danny's learning and it's building 674.9 682.1
RecognizedString greater diversity in brighter complexity and we can see this company of the last four billion years 682.1 687.3
RecognizedString for most that time of life on earth 687.3 689.7
RecognizedString living organisms i've been relatively simple single cells 689.7 693.2
RecognizedString but they had great diversity and inside track complexity 693.2 697
RecognizedString then from about six hundred two eight hundred million years ago multi sold organisms appear 697 702.1
RecognizedString you get fungi you get fish you get love you get i'm finna uk reptiles and then of course you get the dinosaurs 702.1 712.6
RecognizedString and we know how to half but the universe does not travel from marsh to complexity 60.6 66.8
RecognizedString add occasionally third disasters 712.6 715.4
RecognizedString sixty five million years ago 715.4 718.5
RecognizedString an asteroid landed on earth never yucatan peninsula creating conditions equivalent to loads of a nuclear war 718.5 725.3
RecognizedString i'm a dinosaurs are white daft terrible news for the dinosaurs 725.3 730.9
RecognizedString but great news for our mum alien ancestors 730.9 734.6
RecognizedString who florist in the nish is left mt 734.6 738.3
RecognizedString by the dinosaurs and we human beings a part of that creative evolution repulsive began sixty five million years ago with a landing of an asteroid 738.3 749
RecognizedString human stupid about two hundred thousand years ago and i believe we count 749 754.9
RecognizedString as a threshold in this great story i'm explain why 754.9 758.9
RecognizedString we see the dna learns innocent it accumulate information but it is so slow 758.9 766.2
RecognizedString any in find this dot instinct is reflected in one most fundamental laws of physics a second law of thermodynamics all the lord entropy 66.8 75.7
RecognizedString dna accumulate information through random errors that just some of which just happened to work 766.2 772.8
RecognizedString dna hibachi generator to faster way of learning reproduce organisms with brains 772.8 778.3
RecognizedString i'm those organisms can learn in real time they accumulate information bay learn the sad thing is 778.3 785.8
RecognizedString when they die the information dies with them 785.8 789
RecognizedString and what makes humans different 789 791.1
RecognizedString is human language we are blessed with a language assistant communication so powerful 791.1 797
RecognizedString and so precise that we can share what we've learned with such precision 797 801.9
RecognizedString set it can accumulate in the collective memory 801.9 804.5
RecognizedString i'm that means you can out last individuals who learn that information and it can accumulate from generation to generation 804.5 812.8
RecognizedString um that's why is species we so creative and so powerful and that's why we have a history 812.8 819.4
RecognizedString what that says basically is the general tendency of universe 75.7 80.6
RecognizedString we seem to be the only species in four billion years to have this gift 819.4 824.3
RecognizedString i cool disability collective learning it's what makes us different 824.3 830.2
RecognizedString we can see the word in the earlier stages of human history we evolved species in savannah lens of africa 830.2 837.9
RecognizedString but then you see humans migration into new environment into desert lands into jungles internet 837.9 843.8
RecognizedString ice age tundra siberia tough top environment into the america's into austral aisha 843.8 849.6
RecognizedString each vibration involved learning learning new ways exploited environment new ways of dealing with a surrounding 849.6 856.3
RecognizedString ben ten thousand years ago 856.3 858.3
RecognizedString exporting some changing doble climax with the end of last ice age humans learn to farm 858.3 864.9
RecognizedString farming wasn't energy bonanza attic splitting that energy human population multiplied human society is larger dancer more into connected 864.9 875.4
RecognizedString and then from about five hundred years ago 875.4 879
RecognizedString is to move from order on structure 80.6 84.3
RecognizedString humans began to link helped nobody to shipping to trains through telegraph through the internet until now 879 887.4
RecognizedString we seem to form a single global brain of almost seven billion individuals 887.4 893.2
RecognizedString that brain is learning at warp speed 893.2 896.9
RecognizedString another off two hundred you something else was happened we've stumbled on a melba 896.9 901.4
RecognizedString energy bonanza in fossil fuels to fossil fuels and collective learning together explain busta green complexity pc around us 901.4 911.7
RecognizedString song 911.7 914.5
RecognizedString can we are packet convention center weaving on a journey return journey thirteen point seven billion years 914.5 923.2
RecognizedString i hope you're three this is a powerful story 923.2 926
RecognizedString and it's a story in which humans play and astonishing on creative wrong but it also contains warnings 926 933.4
RecognizedString collective learning is a very very powerful force 933.4 938.3
RecognizedString to lack of order lack of structure in fact too much that's why that video fields a bit strange and yet 84.3 93.8
RecognizedString i need not clear that we humans are in charge of it 938.3 943
RecognizedString rumba very vivid lee as a child growing up in england living through the cuban missile crisis 943 949.2
RecognizedString for a few days the entire biosphere seem to be on the verge of destruction 949.2 955.9
RecognizedString and the same weapons are still here and they're still on 955.9 961.2
RecognizedString if we avoid that trap 961.2 963.4
RecognizedString i'll be waiting for us we burning fossil fuels such a right 963.4 967.7
RecognizedString the we seem to be under mining goldie locks condition suck made it possible for human civilization to flourish over the last ten thousand diaz 967.7 977.1
RecognizedString so what big history can do 977.1 979.5
RecognizedString is show austin nature of complexity infidelity on the dangers buttface spirit can also shows a power with collective learning 979.5 988.7
RecognizedString and thou finally 988.7 991.6
RecognizedString look around us what bc around us is tiger in complexity 93.8 99.8
RecognizedString this is what i want 991.6 994.9
RecognizedString i want my grandson daniel 994.9 999.1
RecognizedString and he's friend and he's generation throughout the world to know the story of big history 999.1 1006.4
RecognizedString and to know it's so well 1006.4 1008.5
RecognizedString the understand post challenges faces and the opportunities that face 1008.5 1014.7
RecognizedString um that's why group us a building a free online syllabus in big history for high school students throughout the world we believe 1014.7 1025
RecognizedString the big history will be a vital intellectual to for them has daniel and his generation 1025 1031.6
RecognizedString face the huge challenges 1031.6 1034
RecognizedString and also the huge opportunities ahead of from at this threshold moment in the history of our beautiful planet 1034 1043.3
RecognizedString i thank you for your attention 1043.3 1045.3
RecognizedString every buying hotter estimates in new york city alone there are some ten billion scuse or distant commodities being traded 99.8 107.4
RecognizedString 1045.3 1055.9

RecognizedString being traded my species almost seven billion individuals for linked by trade travel on the internet 111.9 119.2
RecognizedString into adorable system of stupendous complexity 119.2 123.4
RecognizedString so here's a great puzzle 123.4 126.3
RecognizedString in a universe ruled by the second law somo dynamics 126.3 131.4
RecognizedString how is it possible to generator soda complexity artist cried 131.4 135.7
RecognizedString the soda complexity represented by you and me and the convention center 135.7 141.9
RecognizedString what do you want to seems to be the universe can create complexity but with great difficulty 141.9 149.7
RecognizedString in pockets there appear what my colleague fetch me a calls 149.7 154.6
RecognizedString goldilocks conditions not too hot 154.6 157.3
RecognizedString not too cold just right for the creation of complexity 157.3 161
RecognizedString first video 9.2 17.1
RecognizedString i'm soil emo complex things appear 161 163.1
RecognizedString and website emo complex things you can get slightly more complex things and in this way complexity bills stage by stage 163.1 172.1
RecognizedString stage is magical 172.1 175.1
RecognizedString because it creates lee impression of something utterly new appearing almost out of nowhere in the universe we referring big history to these moment sys threshold moments 175.1 185
RecognizedString and each threshold the going gets tapa 185 189
RecognizedString the complex things get more fragile more vulnerable the goldilocks conditions get most transient 189 197.3
RecognizedString and it's more difficult to create complexity 197.3 200.8
RecognizedString no we extremely complex creatures 200.8 204.8
RecognizedString desperately need to know the story of how to universe chris complexity despite the second law and why complexity means vol new bility 204.8 215.4
RecognizedString and fidelity and that's the story that we tell him pig history 215.4 220.3
RecognizedString 17.1 19.5
RecognizedString what to do it you to do something memphis sites incomplete impossible you have to survive bohol history of the universe 220.3 227.9
RecognizedString so let's do it 227.9 230.8
RecognizedString let's begin by winding the timeline back 230.8 236.3
RecognizedString search team point seven billion years to the beginning of time 236.3 243.8
RecognizedString 243.8 248.2
RecognizedString around does this nothing but not even time or space 248.2 254.7
RecognizedString imagine to darkest m this thing you can and cubit gazillion times on thats phobia 254.7 262.5
RecognizedString and then suddenly 262.5 264.6
RecognizedString bomb universe appears an entire universe and we've costa for threshold the universe is tiny smaller than latin it's incredibly hot 264.6 273.8
RecognizedString you contains everything that's in today's universe tweaker magic it's busting and it's expanding at incredible speed 273.8 280.5
RecognizedString yes 19.5 22.5
RecognizedString and at first it's just a bloor but very quickly distinct things begin to appear in that bla 280.5 286.2
RecognizedString within the first second energy itself shutters into distinct horses including electro magnetism and gravity 286.2 293.7
RecognizedString and energy to something else quite magical it can jeans to fall matta 293.7 299.3
RecognizedString clocks to create protons and electrons ring food electrons and all that happens liquor seconds 299.3 305.9
RecognizedString now we move forward three hundred ninety thousand degrees 305.9 310.7
RecognizedString that's twice as long as humans have been on this planet 310.7 314.5
RecognizedString and now simple atoms a pair of hydrogen and helium 314.5 320
RecognizedString no i want to pull through moment three hundred ninety thousand years after the origins of universe because we actually no quite a lot about the universe styles 320 329.1
RecognizedString reno above all tricks extremely simple 329.1 332.2
RecognizedString consisted of huge clouds of hydrogen and helium atoms and they have no structure there really a soda cosmic marsh 332.2 341.2
RecognizedString it is a scrambled egg 22.5 25.3
RecognizedString what packs no completely true 341.2 343.3
RecognizedString recent studies by satellite such a w map satellite 343.3 347.7
RecognizedString i'm shown green factor richer hush tiny differences background what you see here 347.7 353.8
RecognizedString the blue areas or about of five thousand of a degree cooler 353.8 358.7
RecognizedString from the right areas this a tiny differences but it was enough for the universe 358.7 362.9
RecognizedString to move on to the next age building complexity and this is how it works 362.9 366.7
RecognizedString gravity is more powerful willis more stuff 366.7 372
RecognizedString so where gets why didn't areas gravity stop come practing clouds hydrogen and helium atoms 372 378.6
RecognizedString so we can imagine your universe breaking up into a billion clouds 378.6 382.2
RecognizedString and each cloud is compact id gravity gets more powerful as density increases 382.2 387.2
RecognizedString but as you located i hope you begin to fill josh slightly on easy 25.3 33.2
RecognizedString the temperature begins to rise at the center of each cloud and vanitha centrifuge cloud the temperature process the threshold temperature of ten million degrees 387.2 395.9
RecognizedString protons stop to fuse does a huge release of energy 395.9 401
RecognizedString i'm pam we have office stuff 401 405
RecognizedString from about two hundred million years off to the big bang 405 409.4
RecognizedString star speak into appear all through the universe millions of them and the university star significantly more interesting and more complex 409.4 418.7
RecognizedString stalls will create goldilocks conditions for crossing to new for shows 418.7 424.9
RecognizedString when very large stars dawn 424.9 427.7
RecognizedString they create temperature so high 427.7 430.2
RecognizedString the protons begin to fuse in also to exotic combinations 430.2 434
RecognizedString to for all the elements of the periodic table if like me you're wearing a gold rain it was forged in a supernote for explosion 434 442.2
RecognizedString because you may notice look what actually happening is is unscramble yourself 33.2 38.6
RecognizedString to know the universe is chemically more complex 442.2 445.3
RecognizedString uninor chemically more complex universe it's possible to make more things 445.3 450.3
RecognizedString and what stop happening is around young phones young stars 450.3 455.5
RecognizedString all these elements combined a swell around the energy of star store from around 455.5 460.9
RecognizedString play form of particles iphone snowflakes reform little 460.9 464.9
RecognizedString just mosley form roxy form asteroids and veggie the phone planets and moons and that is how our solar systems formed 464.9 473.5
RecognizedString four and a half billion years ago 473.5 476.3
RecognizedString rocky planets like r us 476.3 479.1
RecognizedString a significantly more complex 479.1 481.7
RecognizedString when star because i can taylor much to diversity material to cost for threshold of complexity 481.7 489.3
RecognizedString are you laffy leo can the white separated and now that can be port back into the egg and we will know and i heart of hopsin 38.6 47.2
RecognizedString now the going gets topher 489.3 492.7
RecognizedString the next age introduce is entities significantly more fragile significantly more vulnerable you so much more creative 492.7 501.9
RecognizedString and much more capable of generating feel the complexity on talking of course about living organisms 501.9 508.9
RecognizedString living organisms created by chemistry we are huge packages of chemicals 508.9 514.1
RecognizedString so chemistry is dominated by the electromagnetic force 514.1 518
RecognizedString set operate service maula scales and gravity which explains why you and i smaller than stars or planets 518 524.3
RecognizedString i want to be ideal conditions for chemistry 524.3 527
RecognizedString what up goldilocks conditions won't first you need energy 527 531.4
RecognizedString but not too much central star the so much energy the any atoms combined will just get pasta depart again 531.4 538.6
RecognizedString but not to little in intergalactic space the so little energy atoms can't combine 538.6 544.9
RecognizedString this is not the way the universe works 47.2 51.2
