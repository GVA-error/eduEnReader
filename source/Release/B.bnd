RecognizedString a virtually on known german mathematician name theodor colusa 15.7 22.3
RecognizedString suggested a very bold end 22.3 26
RecognizedString in some ways very bizarre idea he proposed that our universe mine actually have more than the three dimensions 26 34.4
RecognizedString that we are all aware that isn't addition to left right back fourth and up down 34.4 40.1
RecognizedString close it propose at the might be additional dimensions of space that for some reason 40.1 46
RecognizedString we don't yet see now 46 48.8
RecognizedString when someone makes a bolden bizarre idea sometime that old is bulbs are bright has nothing to do with the world around us this particular idea however 48.8 59
RecognizedString although we don't know whether it's right or wrong and at the end of discuss experiments which in the next cheers mate tell us what it's right or wrong this ideas had a major impact on physics in the last century 59 70.6
RecognizedString and continues to inform a lot of cutting edge research i'd like to tell you something about the story of these extra dimensions 70.6 77.9
RecognizedString so what do we go to begin need a backstory 77.9 81.1
RecognizedString go to nineteen oh seven this is a year when einstein is bathinda glow of having discover the special theory of relativity indecisive take on a new 81.1 91.9
RecognizedString project try to understand fully the grand perv a serve force of gravity 91.9 99
RecognizedString and in the moment there are many people around who father that 99 104
RecognizedString project already been resolve newton a given the world 104 107.9
RecognizedString a theory of gravity late sixteen hunters that works well describes the motion applanet the most of the moon and so forest in the motion of 107.9 117.1
RecognizedString a powerful apples find from trees any people head all of add could be describe using newton's work but 117.1 123.5
RecognizedString einstein realize it new net left something out of the story because even newton had written that'll though he understood how 123.5 132
RecognizedString to calculate effective gravity havent unable to figure out how it really works how is it that the sun ninety three million miles away somehow defects 132 141.4
RecognizedString the motion of the earth how does the sun reach out across empty a nerd space and exert 141.4 147.7
RecognizedString influence and that is a task to which einstein set himself to figure out how gravity works and let me show you what it is that he found so einstein found that the medium that transmit 147.7 159.9
RecognizedString gravity is space itself the idea goes like this 159.9 163.4
RecognizedString imagine space is a substrate of all the resign sunset spaces nice in flat 163.4 168.1
RecognizedString if there's no matter present but if there is matter in the environment such as the sonic causes the fabric of space to worp check curve and bakshi mina kate's the force of gravity even the earth 168.1 181.4
RecognizedString war space around it now look at the moon the moon is captain orbit according to is ideas because it rolls along valley in the curved environment that vv 181.4 191.6
RecognizedString sun and the moon and the earth can all create my virtue of there presents we go to of full frame view of this 191.6 198.5
RecognizedString the earth itself is captain or because it rosa long valley in the environment that's curve because of the sons presents 198.5 206.1
RecognizedString that is this new idea about how gravity actually works now 206.1 213.1
RecognizedString this id was tested in nineteen nineteen through astronomical observations it really works describes data and this game to einstein prominent 213.1 222.4
RecognizedString around the world and that is what got 222.4 225.9
RecognizedString call it's a thinking he like einstein was in search of what we call a unified theory 225.9 232.1
RecognizedString that's one theory that might be able to describe all of nature's forces from one sit of ideas one setup principles one master equation if you will supposed to say to himself 232.1 244
RecognizedString hi einstein has been able to describe gravity in terms of worp see curves in space in fact space and time to more precise maybe i can play 244 253.5
RecognizedString the same game with the other known force which was at that time 253.5 258.4
RecognizedString known as the electromagnetic force we know bother today that i that was jani other one people are thinking about your the forces father electricity and magnetic attraction in so fourth 258.4 267.9
RecognizedString circle to says maybe i can play the same game describe electromagnetic force in terms of works in curves that raise the question watching curves in white 267.9 277.8
RecognizedString einstein at already used up space and time 277.8 282.4
RecognizedString watching curves to describe gravity didn't seem to be anything else the war curve suck lucy said well 282.4 290.2
RecognizedString maybe there are more dimensions of spacey said ever want describe one more force maybe i need one more dimension zoe imagine that what had for dimensional space not three 290.2 301
RecognizedString and imagine that electromagnet as watching curves in that fourth dimension 301 305.8
RecognizedString nah here's the thing when he wrote down the equations describing works in curve than universal force base dimensions not three he found the old equations that einstein ahead already driving three dimensions those are for gravity 305.8 317.8
RecognizedString what are you found one more equation because of the one more dimension 317.8 321.7
RecognizedString emily look at that equation it was none other than the equation that scientists head long known to describe electromagnetic force 321.7 329
RecognizedString amazing it just popped up he was so excited by this realization that he ran around is house screaming victory that he it found unified theory 329 340.1
RecognizedString now clearly cutlets was a man who took 340.1 344
RecognizedString theory very seriously he in fact there's a story that when he want to learn how to swim 344 351
RecognizedString he read a book or treat is on swimming then dove into the ocean 351 356.5
RecognizedString this is manhood risk kids life on theory 356.5 360.1
RecognizedString now buffalos abbas her a little more practically minded to questions immediately arise from his observation number one if there are more dimensions is bass where are they 360.1 370.8
RecognizedString you don't seem to see them and number to does this theory really work in detail when you try to apply it to the world 370.8 378.6
RecognizedString around us now the first question 378.6 381.9
RecognizedString was answered in nineteen twenty six by felony moscow klein he's suggested that dimensions mike come into varieties there might be 381.9 390.9
RecognizedString big easy to see dimensions put them i also be tiny curled up dimensions product so small even other all around us 390.9 398.4
RecognizedString that we don't see them let me show you that one visually 398.4 402.3
RecognizedString so imagi looking at something like a cable supporting traffic light sim manhattan new central park and convert relevant but the cable what's one dimensional 402.3 412.3
RecognizedString from a distance view point but you know another does hasn't thickness it's very hard to see the from far away but we zoom in 412.3 419.7
RecognizedString and take your perspective it's a little am walking around little answer so small that they can access all dimensions the long dimension balls this clockwise or counterclockwise direction in 419.7 430.6
RecognizedString i hope you preciate as it took so long to get these ants to do this put this illustrate the fact that dimensions cambia tu sorts big and small 430.6 439.8
RecognizedString and the ideas maybe the big dimensions around us other ones that we can easily c 439.8 444.8
RecognizedString but there might be additional dimensions curled up sort of like the circular part of that cable so small 444.8 451.1
RecognizedString that they have so far remained invisible let me show with that would look like so we take a look say at space itself 451.1 460
RecognizedString i can only show of course to dimensions on a screen some you gotta fix that one day but anything that's not flat screen as a new dimension go smaller 460 467.6
RecognizedString smaller smaller and way down in the microscopic depths of space itself this is the idea 467.6 473.9
RecognizedString you could have additional curled up dimensions here's a little shape of a circle so small that we don't see them 473.9 479
RecognizedString but if you were a little ultra microscopic aunt walking randy can walk in the big mentioned that we all know about that's like the grid part 479 486.2
RecognizedString what you can also access the tiny curled up dimension that so small that we can't see with a naked iyer even with any ramos refind equipment but deeply talked 486.2 495.8
RecognizedString into the fabric of space itself the ideas the could be more dimensions as we see there now 495.8 503.5
RecognizedString that's an explanation 503.5 506.4
RecognizedString about how the universe could have more dimensions than the ones that we see but what about the second question that i asked does it theory actually work when you try to reply to the real world 506.4 516.8
RecognizedString well turns out that einstein includes and many others worked on trying to refine this framework and apply it too 516.8 525.8
RecognizedString the physics of universe as was understood at the time 525.8 529.6
RecognizedString any detail didn't work and detail friends that couldn't get the mass of the electronic workout correctly in this theory so many people work donna popeye the 529.6 539.4
RecognizedString fourty certainly by the fifties this strange but very compelling idea of how to unify the laws of physics had gone away 539.4 549
RecognizedString until something wonderful happened in our h 549 552.6
RecognizedString in our area of a new approach to unify the laws of physics is being pursued by physicistt such myself many others around the world is called super string theory as you are indicating 552.6 564
RecognizedString and the wonderful thing is that super string theory has nothing to do at first sight with this idea of actor dimensions 564 572
RecognizedString but we study super string theory find resurrect 572 575.4
RecognizedString the idea no sparkling new for let me just tell you how that goes super string theory what is it was a fear the tries to answer the question 575.4 583.5
RecognizedString what are the basic fundamental indivisible uncomfortable constantia once 583.5 589.1
RecognizedString making up everything in the world around us 589.1 592.7
RecognizedString the idea is like this so imagine we look at a familiar object just a candle in a holder and imagine that we wanna figure out what it is maydah so we going to journey deep inside the object nick salmon 592.7 606.1
RecognizedString the can stitch wants to deep inside the all know yos officially far down you have adams 606.1 611
RecognizedString we also all know the adams not the end of the story they had little electrons it's warm miranda central nucleus with neutron protons 611 619
RecognizedString even a neutron protons of small particles inside of them known as corpse that is were conventional idea stop 619 626.5
RecognizedString here's the new idea of string theory 626.5 629.1
RecognizedString deep inside any of these particles there is something else the something else is this dancing filament of energy it looks like a vibrating string 629.1 638.3
RecognizedString that's where the idea string theory comes from and just like the vibrating strings that you just sona chela can vibrate indifferent patterns these can also vibrating different patterns 638.3 647.6
RecognizedString the don't produce different musical notes rather they produce 647.6 650.7
RecognizedString the different particles making up the world around us that these ideas are correct this is what the ultra microscopic landscape 650.7 657.5
RecognizedString of the universe looks like it's buildup of a huge number of the little tiny phil immense 657.5 664
RecognizedString a vibrating energy vibrating indifferent frequencies it different frequencies produce the different particles different particles are responsible 664 673.8
RecognizedString for all the rich this in the world around us and they're you see unification because matter particles electrons in corpse radiation particles fo times gravity cats are all built up from one entity 673.8 687.5
RecognizedString some matter and the forces of nature all 687.5 690.5
RecognizedString are put together under the rubrica vibrating strings and that's what we mean by a unified theory and here is the catch 690.5 699.6
RecognizedString when you study the mathematics or string theory you find the doesn't work in a universe adjust has three dimensions of space it doesn't work any universe with for dimensional space nor five nor sex 699.6 711.8
RecognizedString finally you can study the equation show that it works only any universe that has ten dimensions of space 711.8 719.3
RecognizedString and one dimension of time 719.3 722.2
RecognizedString leaders right back to this idea of clues incline that are world when appropriately described has more dimensions than the ones that we see 722.2 733.1
RecognizedString now you might think about that say well ok enough yeah baxter dimensions into really tightly crawled up 733.1 739.3
RecognizedString yep perhaps perhaps we won't see them if there's more enough but you know if there's a little tiny civilization agree people walking around and they're you make them small enough we won't see them either 739.3 749
RecognizedString that is true one of the other predictions of string theory 749 753.8
RecognizedString no its not one of the other predictions of string theory but erase the question are we just tryna hideaway these actually dimensions or 753.8 762.7
RecognizedString do they tell or something about the world and the remaining tom i'd like to tell you to features of them 762.7 768.5
RecognizedString first is many of as believe that these actor dimensions hold the answer to what perhaps is the deepest question in theoretical physics theoretical science in that question is this when we look around the world 768.5 783.4
RecognizedString as scientists of down for less hundred years there appear to be about twenty numbers 783.4 787.9
RecognizedString not really describe our universities are numbers like the mass of the particles like electrons in corpse 787.9 793.7
RecognizedString the strength of gravity the strength of the electromagnetic force a list about twenty numbers that happened measured with incredible precision but nobody has an explanation for why the numbers have the particular values that they do 793.7 807.7
RecognizedString now 807.7 809.8
RecognizedString does string theory often answer not yet but we believe the answer for why those numbers have devise a do mabe rely on the form of the actor dimensions and the wonderful thing is if those numbers had any other vi is then the known once 809.8 823.1
RecognizedString the universe as we know it wouldn't exist 823.1 826.3
RecognizedString this is a deep question why this number so finally tude to stars to shinin planets to form when we recognize that you fiddle with those numbers if i had twenty dials up karna let you come up and sit with us numbers 826.3 838.9
RecognizedString almost any filling makes 838.9 841.7
RecognizedString the evers disappear to can we explain those twenty numbers and string theory suggested this twenty numbers have to do with the actor dimensions let me show you how 841.7 852.4
RecognizedString so when we talk about the actor dimensions in string theory 852.4 856.1
RecognizedString it's not one actually dimension as in the older ideas of colusa and klein this is what string theory says about the actually dimensions they have a very rich 856.1 866.6
RecognizedString enter twice find geometry this is an example of something on a zack labia shape name isn't all that important but as you can see 866.6 875.5
RecognizedString the extra dimensions fold n on themselves in ensure twine and a very interesting shape interesting structure any ideas that if this is what 875.5 885.1
RecognizedString the su dimensions look like then the microscopic landscape of our universe all around us 885.1 891.4
RecognizedString would look like this on the tiniest of scales when you swing your hand ub moving around is actually dimensions over and over again but they're so small that we wouldn't know it 891.4 899.9
RecognizedString so what is the physical implication no relevant plus twenty numbers consider this 899.9 904.2
RecognizedString you look at the instrument a french or notice at the vibrations of air streams are affected by the shape of the instrument now and string theory all the numbers 904.2 913.3
RecognizedString i reflections of the way strings can vibrate to just those air streams are affected by the twists and turns in the instrument 913.3 921
RecognizedString strings themselves be affected by the vibration or patterns in geometry 921 925.5
RecognizedString within which they are moving salami bracing strings into the story and if you watch these little feliz vibrating around 925.5 931.9
RecognizedString the bihar into zack and right there north away vibrate is affected by the geometry the actor dimensions so if we knew exactly what the actually dimensions looks like we don't yet but if we did 931.9 943
RecognizedString we should be able to calculate the allowed notes 943 945.8
RecognizedString the allowed vibration or patterns and if we can talk like a vibration of patterns we should be able to calculate 945.8 952.8
RecognizedString those twenty numbers have the answer that we get from are calculations 952.8 957.7
RecognizedString agrees with the values of those numbers that have been determine through detailed in precise experiment tation 957.7 964.9
RecognizedString this in many ways would be the first fundamental explanation for why the structure of the universe is 964.9 972.9
RecognizedString the way it is now the second su that i want to finish up with is how my we 972.9 979.4
RecognizedString test for these extra dimensions more directly is this just in interesting mathematical structure that might be able to explain some 979.4 989.4
RecognizedString previously on explain features of the world 989.4 992.5
RecognizedString or can we actually test for the jackson dimensions and we sake as i think very exciting that the next five years are so we may be able to test for the existence of these exit imagines here's how it goes 992.5 1006.4
RecognizedString in cern geneva switzerland a machine is being built the large hadron collider 1006.4 1012.1
RecognizedString it's machine that was in particles around tunnel opposite directions near the speed of light every so often as particles will be aim that each other to lose ahead on collision 1012.1 1022.5
RecognizedString the hope is that if the collision as enough energy it may a jacked 1022.5 1028.8
RecognizedString some of the debrief from the collision from our dimensions 1028.8 1032.9
RecognizedString forcing it to enter into the other dimensions 1032.9 1035.9
RecognizedString how we know it wobble measure the amount of energy after the collision compare it the math energy before afters less energy 1035.9 1044.4
RecognizedString after the collision them before this will be evidence that the energy has drift away if address away the right pattern that we can calculate this a b evidence 1044.4 1052.5
RecognizedString that the actually dimensions are there let me show you that idea visually 1052.5 1056.2
RecognizedString so magine we have a certain kinda particles color grab a ton that's kind of debris we expect to be eject it out if the actor dimensions a real but here's had experimental go 1056.2 1067.2
RecognizedString you take he's particles you slam together you slam it together and if we are write some of the energy that collision will going to debris that flies off 1067.2 1076.3
RecognizedString into these actually dimensions so this is a kind of experiment that will be looking at the next five 1076.3 1081.8
RecognizedString seven two ten years yourself and 1081.8 1084.7
RecognizedString if this experiment bears fruit if we see that kind of particle injected 1084.7 1089.5
RecognizedString by noticing that there's less energy in our dimensions then when we began this will show the theater dimensions are real 1089.5 1097.5
RecognizedString enemy this is a really remarkable store in a remarkable opportunity going back to newton with absolute space didn't 1097.5 1104.6
RecognizedString pride anything burner reno stage in which the events the universe take place einstein comes along in says what space and time can worp and curve that's were gravity is and now 1104.6 1114.9
RecognizedString string theory comes along and says yes gravity quantum mechanics electra magnum altogether one package but only if the universe has more dimensions than the ones that we see 1114.9 1127.1
RecognizedString and this is an experiment that may test for them in our lifetime 1127.1 1131.9
RecognizedString mazing possible thank you very much 1131.9 1143.9
RecognizedString a virtually on known german mathematician name theodor colusa 15.7 22.3
RecognizedString suggested a very bold end 22.3 26
RecognizedString in some ways very bizarre idea he proposed that our universe mine actually have more than the three dimensions 26 34.4
RecognizedString that we are all aware that isn't addition to left right back fourth and up down 34.4 40.1
RecognizedString close it propose at the might be additional dimensions of space that for some reason 40.1 46
RecognizedString we don't yet see now 46 48.8
RecognizedString when someone makes a bolden bizarre idea sometime that old is bulbs are bright has nothing to do with the world around us this particular idea however 48.8 59
RecognizedString although we don't know whether it's right or wrong and at the end of discuss experiments which in the next cheers mate tell us what it's right or wrong this ideas had a major impact on physics in the last century 59 70.6
RecognizedString and continues to inform a lot of cutting edge research i'd like to tell you something about the story of these extra dimensions 70.6 77.9
RecognizedString so what do we go to begin need a backstory 77.9 81.1
RecognizedString go to nineteen oh seven this is a year when einstein is bathinda glow of having discover the special theory of relativity indecisive take on a new 81.1 91.9
RecognizedString project try to understand fully the grand perv a serve force of gravity 91.9 99
RecognizedString and in the moment there are many people around who father that 99 104
RecognizedString project already been resolve newton a given the world 104 107.9
RecognizedString a theory of gravity late sixteen hunters that works well describes the motion applanet the most of the moon and so forest in the motion of 107.9 117.1
RecognizedString a powerful apples find from trees any people head all of add could be describe using newton's work but 117.1 123.5
RecognizedString einstein realize it new net left something out of the story because even newton had written that'll though he understood how 123.5 132
RecognizedString to calculate effective gravity havent unable to figure out how it really works how is it that the sun ninety three million miles away somehow defects 132 141.4
RecognizedString the motion of the earth how does the sun reach out across empty a nerd space and exert 141.4 147.7
RecognizedString influence and that is a task to which einstein set himself to figure out how gravity works and let me show you what it is that he found so einstein found that the medium that transmit 147.7 159.9
RecognizedString gravity is space itself the idea goes like this 159.9 163.4
RecognizedString imagine space is a substrate of all the resign sunset spaces nice in flat 163.4 168.1
RecognizedString if there's no matter present but if there is matter in the environment such as the sonic causes the fabric of space to worp check curve and bakshi mina kate's the force of gravity even the earth 168.1 181.4
RecognizedString war space around it now look at the moon the moon is captain orbit according to is ideas because it rolls along valley in the curved environment that vv 181.4 191.6
RecognizedString sun and the moon and the earth can all create my virtue of there presents we go to of full frame view of this 191.6 198.5
RecognizedString the earth itself is captain or because it rosa long valley in the environment that's curve because of the sons presents 198.5 206.1
RecognizedString that is this new idea about how gravity actually works now 206.1 213.1
RecognizedString this id was tested in nineteen nineteen through astronomical observations it really works describes data and this game to einstein prominent 213.1 222.4
RecognizedString around the world and that is what got 222.4 225.9
RecognizedString call it's a thinking he like einstein was in search of what we call a unified theory 225.9 232.1
RecognizedString that's one theory that might be able to describe all of nature's forces from one sit of ideas one setup principles one master equation if you will supposed to say to himself 232.1 244
RecognizedString hi einstein has been able to describe gravity in terms of worp see curves in space in fact space and time to more precise maybe i can play 244 253.5
RecognizedString the same game with the other known force which was at that time 253.5 258.4
RecognizedString known as the electromagnetic force we know bother today that i that was jani other one people are thinking about your the forces father electricity and magnetic attraction in so fourth 258.4 267.9
RecognizedString circle to says maybe i can play the same game describe electromagnetic force in terms of works in curves that raise the question watching curves in white 267.9 277.8
RecognizedString einstein at already used up space and time 277.8 282.4
RecognizedString watching curves to describe gravity didn't seem to be anything else the war curve suck lucy said well 282.4 290.2
RecognizedString maybe there are more dimensions of spacey said ever want describe one more force maybe i need one more dimension zoe imagine that what had for dimensional space not three 290.2 301
RecognizedString and imagine that electromagnet as watching curves in that fourth dimension 301 305.8
RecognizedString nah here's the thing when he wrote down the equations describing works in curve than universal force base dimensions not three he found the old equations that einstein ahead already driving three dimensions those are for gravity 305.8 317.8

RecognizedString amazing it just popped up he was so excited by this realization that he ran around is house screaming victory that he it found unified theory 329 340.1
RecognizedString now clearly cutlets was a man who took 340.1 344
RecognizedString theory very seriously he in fact there's a story that when he want to learn how to swim 344 351
RecognizedString he read a book or treat is on swimming then dove into the ocean 351 356.5
RecognizedString this is manhood risk kids life on theory 356.5 360.1
RecognizedString now buffalos abbas her a little more practically minded to questions immediately arise from his observation number one if there are more dimensions is bass where are they 360.1 370.8
RecognizedString you don't seem to see them and number to does this theory really work in detail when you try to apply it to the world 370.8 378.6

RecognizedString even a neutron protons of small particles inside of them known as corpse that is were conventional idea stop 619 626.5
RecognizedString here's the new idea of string theory 626.5 629.1
RecognizedString deep inside any of these particles there is something else the something else is this dancing filament of energy it looks like a vibrating string 629.1 638.3
RecognizedString that's where the idea string theory comes from and just like the vibrating strings that you just sona chela can vibrate indifferent patterns these can also vibrating different patterns 638.3 647.6
RecognizedString the don't produce different musical notes rather they produce 647.6 650.7
RecognizedString the different particles making up the world around us that these ideas are correct this is what the ultra microscopic landscape 650.7 657.5
RecognizedString of the universe looks like it's buildup of a huge number of the little tiny phil immense 657.5 664
RecognizedString a vibrating energy vibrating indifferent frequencies it different frequencies produce the different particles different particles are responsible 664 673.8
RecognizedString for all the rich this in the world around us and they're you see unification because matter particles electrons in corpse radiation particles fo times gravity cats are all built up from one entity 673.8 687.5
RecognizedString some matter and the forces of nature all 687.5 690.5
RecognizedString are put together under the rubrica vibrating strings and that's what we mean by a unified theory and here is the catch 690.5 699.6
RecognizedString when you study the mathematics or string theory you find the doesn't work in a universe adjust has three dimensions of space it doesn't work any universe with for dimensional space nor five nor sex 699.6 711.8
RecognizedString finally you can study the equation show that it works only any universe that has ten dimensions of space 711.8 719.3
RecognizedString and one dimension of time 719.3 722.2
RecognizedString leaders right back to this idea of clues incline that are world when appropriately described has more dimensions than the ones that we see 722.2 733.1
RecognizedString now you might think about that say well ok enough yeah baxter dimensions into really tightly crawled up 733.1 739.3
RecognizedString yep perhaps perhaps we won't see them if there's more enough but you know if there's a little tiny civilization agree people walking around and they're you make them small enough we won't see them either 739.3 749
RecognizedString that is true one of the other predictions of string theory 749 753.8
RecognizedString no its not one of the other predictions of string theory but erase the question are we just tryna hideaway these actually dimensions or 753.8 762.7
RecognizedString do they tell or something about the world and the remaining tom i'd like to tell you to features of them 762.7 768.5
RecognizedString first is many of as believe that these actor dimensions hold the answer to what perhaps is the deepest question in theoretical physics theoretical science in that question is this when we look around the world 768.5 783.4
RecognizedString as scientists of down for less hundred years there appear to be about twenty numbers 783.4 787.9
RecognizedString not really describe our universities are numbers like the mass of the particles like electrons in corpse 787.9 793.7
RecognizedString the strength of gravity the strength of the electromagnetic force a list about twenty numbers that happened measured with incredible precision but nobody has an explanation for why the numbers have the particular values that they do 793.7 807.7
RecognizedString does string theory often answer not yet but we believe the answer for why those numbers have devise a do mabe rely on the form of the actor dimensions and the wonderful thing is if those numbers had any other vi is then the known once 809.8 823.1
RecognizedString the universe as we know it wouldn't exist 823.1 826.3
RecognizedString this is a deep question why this number so finally tude to stars to shinin planets to form when we recognize that you fiddle with those numbers if i had twenty dials up karna let you come up and sit with us numbers 826.3 838.9
RecognizedString almost any filling makes 838.9 841.7
RecognizedString the evers disappear to can we explain those twenty numbers and string theory suggested this twenty numbers have to do with the actor dimensions let me show you how 841.7 852.4
RecognizedString so when we talk about the actor dimensions in string theory 852.4 856.1
RecognizedString it's not one actually dimension as in the older ideas of colusa and klein this is what string theory says about the actually dimensions they have a very rich 856.1 866.6
RecognizedString enter twice find geometry this is an example of something on a zack labia shape name isn't all that important but as you can see 866.6 875.5
RecognizedString the extra dimensions fold n on themselves in ensure twine and a very interesting shape interesting structure any ideas that if this is what 875.5 885.1
RecognizedString the su dimensions look like then the microscopic landscape of our universe all around us 885.1 891.4
RecognizedString would look like this on the tiniest of scales when you swing your hand ub moving around is actually dimensions over and over again but they're so small that we wouldn't know it 891.4 899.9
RecognizedString so what is the physical implication no relevant plus twenty numbers consider this 899.9 904.2
RecognizedString you look at the instrument a french or notice at the vibrations of air streams are affected by the shape of the instrument now and string theory all the numbers 904.2 913.3
RecognizedString i reflections of the way strings can vibrate to just those air streams are affected by the twists and turns in the instrument 913.3 921
RecognizedString strings themselves be affected by the vibration or patterns in geometry 921 925.5
RecognizedString within which they are moving salami bracing strings into the story and if you watch these little feliz vibrating around 925.5 931.9
RecognizedString the bihar into zack and right there north away vibrate is affected by the geometry the actor dimensions so if we knew exactly what the actually dimensions looks like we don't yet but if we did 931.9 943
RecognizedString we should be able to calculate the allowed notes 943 945.8
RecognizedString the allowed vibration or patterns and if we can talk like a vibration of patterns we should be able to calculate 945.8 952.8
RecognizedString those twenty numbers have the answer that we get from are calculations 952.8 957.7
RecognizedString agrees with the values of those numbers that have been determine through detailed in precise experiment tation 957.7 964.9
RecognizedString this in many ways would be the first fundamental explanation for why the structure of the universe is 964.9 972.9
RecognizedString the way it is now the second su that i want to finish up with is how my we 972.9 979.4
RecognizedString test for these extra dimensions more directly is this just in interesting mathematical structure that might be able to explain some 979.4 989.4
RecognizedString previously on explain features of the world 989.4 992.5
RecognizedString or can we actually test for the jackson dimensions and we sake as i think very exciting that the next five years are so we may be able to test for the existence of these exit imagines here's how it goes 992.5 1006.4
RecognizedString in cern geneva switzerland a machine is being built the large hadron collider 1006.4 1012.1
RecognizedString it's machine that was in particles around tunnel opposite directions near the speed of light every so often as particles will be aim that each other to lose ahead on collision 1012.1 1022.5
RecognizedString the hope is that if the collision as enough energy it may a jacked 1022.5 1028.8
RecognizedString some of the debrief from the collision from our dimensions 1028.8 1032.9
RecognizedString forcing it to enter into the other dimensions 1032.9 1035.9
RecognizedString how we know it wobble measure the amount of energy after the collision compare it the math energy before afters less energy 1035.9 1044.4
RecognizedString after the collision them before this will be evidence that the energy has drift away if address away the right pattern that we can calculate this a b evidence 1044.4 1052.5
RecognizedString that the actually dimensions are there let me show you that idea visually 1052.5 1056.2
RecognizedString so magine we have a certain kinda particles color grab a ton that's kind of debris we expect to be eject it out if the actor dimensions a real but here's had experimental go 1056.2 1067.2
RecognizedString you take he's particles you slam together you slam it together and if we are write some of the energy that collision will going to debris that flies off 1067.2 1076.3
RecognizedString into these actually dimensions so this is a kind of experiment that will be looking at the next five 1076.3 1081.8
RecognizedString if this experiment bears fruit if we see that kind of particle injected 1084.7 1089.5
RecognizedString by noticing that there's less energy in our dimensions then when we began this will show the theater dimensions are real 1089.5 1097.5
RecognizedString enemy this is a really remarkable store in a remarkable opportunity going back to newton with absolute space didn't 1097.5 1104.6
RecognizedString pride anything burner reno stage in which the events the universe take place einstein comes along in says what space and time can worp and curve that's were gravity is and now 1104.6 1114.9
RecognizedString string theory comes along and says yes gravity quantum mechanics electra magnum altogether one package but only if the universe has more dimensions than the ones that we see 1114.9 1127.1
RecognizedString and this is an experiment that may test for them in our lifetime 1127.1 1131.9
RecognizedString mazing possible thank you very much 1131.9 1143.9
